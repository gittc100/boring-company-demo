# Boring Company Demo

## Description
The Purpose of this project is to evaluate the overall system requirements for the boring company's transportation network and provide a feature [Demo](##Demo). 

#### General Notes
- All Diagrams/Illistrations were created with the free program [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and are stored as svg's in the [illistrations](./illistrations) folder.

## Boring Company Objective's

Provide method's of increasing transportation rates via: 
- Electric Vehicle Sub Surface Transportation
- Hyper Loop Sub Surface Transportation

## Initial Observations
- Use smaller single size diameter tunnels (12ft)
- Tunnels will only support a single lane
- Ideal Electric Vehicle Maximum Velocity 150mph
- Mixture Between railed/free electric vehicle tunnels
- Moving to surface launch and porpoising

![Station2](./imgs/Station2.png)
![Station3](./imgs/Station3.png)

## My Assumption's
- Smaller Equipment/Tunnels is ideal will reduce cost and complexity
- Currently using bumper rails for high speeds will eventualy move to railess
- Surface launch and porpoising will make entry and exit speed's high
- Greatess complexity will be terminal design and traffic control
- Minimum aproach to hardware requirements
    - Wireless Accesspoints
    - Video/Audio
    - Air Sensors
    - Ventilation Management

### The Evaluation will include:
- [Traffic Control Architecture](## "Traffic Control Architecture")
- [Automotive Embedded Architecture](## "Automotive Embedded Architecture")
- [Network Software Architecture](## "Network Software Architecture")
- [Network Hardware Architecture](## "Network Hardware Architecture")
- [Summary](##Summary)
- [Demo](##Demo)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
